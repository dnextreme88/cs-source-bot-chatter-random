# Introduction

This is a simple SourceMod plugin personally made by me that introduces random bot chatter similar to CS 1.3.

## Installation

Installation is fairly simple: 

1. First, get a dedicated server. You can follow the instructions at this [Steam tutorial](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=397365275).

2. Download [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php) and extract the contents to your dedicated server's `cstrike/` directory.

3. Clone this repository and extract the contents to your dedicated server's `cstrike/` directory.

4. Run your dedicated server, and set it up based on the Steam tutorial link provided above. On your dedicated server's console, load the plugin with `sm plugins load bot_chatter_random.smx` to load it individually or `sm plugins unload_all` then `sm plugins refresh` to refresh all your plugins.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Please create a new branch and make a pull request to the main branch so that I'll review the changes and approve it if it's beneficial enough. There are still a lot of unused chat in [botchat.txt](botchat.txt) that needs to be implemented and hoping someone could help me refactor the script to be shorter and complete.
